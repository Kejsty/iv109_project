Complicated map with static initial population

{'#': -5, '*': 20, '.': 1}
POPULATION_SIZE = 100
GENERATION_COUNT = 1000
We tried different probabilities:

	crossover = 0.8, mutation = 0.05: 

		best = 155.3, mean = 124.477, worst = -82.3

	crossover = 0.8, mutation = 0.1: 

		best = 148.5, mean = 119.74, worst = -88.6

	crossover = 0.8, mutation = 0.2: 

		best = 140.1, mean = 107.027, worst = -97.3

	crossover = 0.7, mutation = 0.05: 

		best = 165.4, mean = 115.37, worst = -70.2

	crossover = 0.7, mutation = 0.1: 

		best = 152.1, mean = 97.868, worst = -126.6

	crossover = 0.7, mutation = 0.2: 

		best = 135.5, mean = 90.352, worst = -103.6

	crossover = 0.6, mutation = 0.05: 

		best = 162.0, mean = 98.587, worst = -94.4

	crossover = 0.6, mutation = 0.1: 

		best = 161.9, mean = 92.911, worst = -119.7

	crossover = 0.6, mutation = 0.2:
