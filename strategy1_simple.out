Simple map with static initial population

{'#': -5, '*': 20, '.': 1}
POPULATION_SIZE = 100
GENERATION_COUNT = 1000
We tried different probabilities:

	crossover = 0.8, mutation = 0.05: 

		best = 196.0, mean = 160.914, worst = -2.8

	crossover = 0.8, mutation = 0.1: 

		best = 184.7, mean = 146.175, worst = -10.0

	crossover = 0.8, mutation = 0.2: 

		best = 173.4, mean = 135.798, worst = -49.7

	crossover = 0.7, mutation = 0.05: 

		best = 201.7, mean = 146.792, worst = 1.1

	crossover = 0.7, mutation = 0.1: 

		best = 184.5, mean = 128.331, worst = -15.8

	crossover = 0.7, mutation = 0.2: 

		best = 166.1, mean = 112.903, worst = -33.5

	crossover = 0.6, mutation = 0.05: 

		best = 199.3, mean = 131.237, worst = 2.7

	crossover = 0.6, mutation = 0.1: 

		best = 183.0, mean = 110.232, worst = -28.6

	crossover = 0.6, mutation = 0.2: 

		best = 174.3, mean = 98.907, worst = -43.0
